# analyis_of_day_data

This repository contains the implementation of the analysis of day data.
The folders contain the analysis for each algorithm.

all_algorithms:
  - creates plots that compare the results of all algorithms

interior-point:
  - creates all plots for the interior-point-method

mod_kruskal:
  - creates all plots for the modified kruskal algorithm

simplex:
  - creates all plots for the simplex algorithm

revised simplex:
  - creates all plots for the revised simplex algorithm

network simplex:
  - creates all plots for the network simplex algorithm
 
 
 # programs
 scalablePricesScatterMinMax.py
 - contains functions to plot all reached prices, all reached average prices,
   the minimaleached price and the maximal reached price of an algorithm
  
scaledRuntimeAndDeviation.py
- contains functions to plot the reached running times and the deviation of
  the runningtimes of an algortihm over all test runs
  
usedReductions.py
- contains functions to plot the used reductions of an algorithm
