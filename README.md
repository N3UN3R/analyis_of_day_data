# analyis_of_day_data

This repository contains the implementation of the analysis of day data.
The repository is structured as follows:

all_algorithms:
  - creates plots that compare the results of all algorithms

interior-point:
  - creates all plots for the interior-point-method

mod_kruskal:
  - creates all plots for the modified kruskal algorithm

simplex:
  - creates all plots for the simplex algorithm

revised simplex:
  - creates all plots for the revised simplex algorithm

network simplex:
  - creates all plots for the network simplex algorithm
